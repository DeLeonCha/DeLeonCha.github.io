About tghe Game

ETERNALV is an RPG I built from scratch using C. It’s a story-rich, text-based game where your decisions actually change how 
everything plays out. With branching paths, combat mechanics, and a reincarnation system, meaning? every run can be a new story.

What’s Inside:
Dynamic Story & Multiple Endings
Choices you make shift the dialogue and unlock different outcomes.

Turn-Based Combat
Features crits, bonus damage, scaling stats, and tactical decision-making.

Enemy Variety
Fight different enemies with unique stats and loot drops. Stronger foes drop better gear or rare crafting stuff.

Leveling System
Grow your HP, ATK, DEF, EXP, and Level over time and even carry progress through reincarnations.

Inventory & Crafting
Collect materials and craft items to boost your stats or help in tough fights.

Reincarnation Mechanic
If you die, you start again, but stronger, with your past life’s experience helping you forge a new path.
