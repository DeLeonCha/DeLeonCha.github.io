About the Game
ETERNALV is a decision-driven, text-based RPG developed in C. Built from scratch to deliver an immersive journey through fate, combat, and consequence. Players traverse a branching story with 3 distinct endings, where every choice ripples through a world designed around narrative depth and mechanical complexity.

Key Features:
Narrative with Branching Paths
Dialogue changes dynamically. Your decisions shape your story, leading to multiple endings.

Custom Combat System
Includes critical hits, bonus damage, and scaling stats. Combat is turn-based, tactical, and brutal.

Diverse Enemies with Unique Stats & Loot
Battle a variety of foes — each with their own HP, attack styles, and drop tables. Defeating stronger enemies may reward rare crafting materials or powerful items.

Leveling & Status Progression
Scale your HP, ATK, DEF, EXP, and Level. Your character evolves as you battle, explore, and make choices with stats carrying over through reincarnation.

Inventory & Crafting System
Use materials from enemies or events to forge items, boost stats, and survive harder fights.

Reincarnation Mechanic
Death isn’t the end. Begin again, carrying over your past life’s growth to rewrite your fate.
